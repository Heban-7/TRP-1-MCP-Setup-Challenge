# Agent Rules: Boris Cherny Workflow & Best Practices

## 1. Plan Before Action

- ALWAYS start complex tasks in "Plan Mode" (Shift+Tab twice).
- Generate a detailed execution plan and wait for user approval before modifying code.
- If a task becomes stuck, revert to Plan Mode to re-evaluate the architecture.

## 2. Context Engineering (CLAUDE.md)

- Maintain a `CLAUDE.md` file in the root to store project guidelines, tech stack, and common commands.
- **Rule of Correction**: Every time a mistake is made, immediately update `CLAUDE.md` with a "Common Mistake to Avoid" to prevent it from happening again.

## 3. Tool Usage & Integrity

- Never speculate about code. You MUST read a file before answering questions or making claims about it.
- Use the Tenx MCP analysis tools to log interactions and ensure feedback loops are active.

## 4. Code Quality

- Keep changes simple and surgical. Impact as few lines as possible.
- Use sub-agents for specialized tasks like code simplification or verification.
